== Overview

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kuryr SDN Administration is a Technology Preview feature.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see

(or Kuryr-Kubernetes) is one of the SDN choices for {product-title}. Kuryr uses
an OpenStack networking service, Neutron, to connect pods to the network. With
this method, pods can have inter-connectivity with OpenStack virtual machines
(VMs), which is useful for {product-title} clusters deployed on OpenStack VMs.

=== Orphaned OpenStack Resources

All OpenStack resources created by Kuryr are tied to the {product-title}
resources lifecycle .Manually deleting resources created by Kuryr, such as
OpenStack VMs, can result in the OpenStack deployment having orphaned resources.
This includes, but is not limited to, Neutron ports, Octavia, load balancers,
networks, subnets, and security groups pre-created for Kuryr's use. Orphaned
resources can be properly removed by looking up the resource IDs found within
the *_kuryr.conf_* file. Alternatively, if the Kuryr resources were created by a
separate OpenStack user, you can query the OpenStack APIs with the associated
user name.
